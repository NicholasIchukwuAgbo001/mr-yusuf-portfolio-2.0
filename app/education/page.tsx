          My educational journey has shaped both my technical expertise and
          problem-solving mindset. I started with a strong foundation in{" "}
          <span className="text-secondary">Mathematics</span>, where I
          gained core knowledge in programming, algorithms, and system design.
          Over time, I advanced into specialized areas such as{" "}
          <span className="text-secondary">Backend Development</span>,
          <span className="text-secondary">Databases</span>, and{" "}
          <span className="text-secondary">Cloud Technologies</span>. Alongside
          formal studies, I continuously sharpened my skills through online
          certifications, hands-on projects, and real-world application of
          modern technologies. This blend of academic training and practical
          learning has prepared me to build scalable, secure, and efficient
          solutions for todayâ€™s digital challenges.
